rompt for Portfolio Website

I need to create a Portfolio Website for my university Professional Skills module, showcasing what I learned throughout the semester.

Website Requirements

UI/UX

Clean, modern, and responsive website design.

Use frameworks like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and optionally Bootstrap/Tailwind for styling.

Smooth and professional navigation with a focus on readability.

Animations

Add proper animations for transitions (e.g., smooth scrolling, fade-ins, hover effects).

Animations should enhance user experience without being distracting.

Content Management

Each chapter will have its own dedicated page.

I will add text and images later.

If an image is not provided, the design should automatically hide the placeholder.

Navigation

A navigation bar available on all pages, allowing direct access to every chapter and the “About Me” page.

At the end of each chapter, include a “Next Chapter” button or auto-redirect to move forward sequentially.

Website Structure

Start Page (Welcome Page)

Display:

My name

Registration ID

Title: “Professional Skills”

Chapter Pages (Each Topic)
Each of the following chapters should have its own dedicated page:

Chapter 1 – CV Writing

Chapter 2 – Portfolio Management

Chapter 3 – ARCSCU (Keynote Speeches Assignment)

Chapter 4 – Research Writing

Chapter 5 – Food Festival

Chapter 6 – Interview Skills

Chapter 7 – Email Writing

Chapter 8 – Nepal Miss (Emotional Intelligence)

Chapter 9 – Professional, Telephone, and Dining Etiquette
