CV Writing 

First page 
Indrouctions	
A CV is a formal document that provides a detailed summary of a person's abilities, skills, and professional experience for a potential employer.

    A CV (Curriculum Vitae) is a longer, more detailed document, often used for academic or research positions.

    A resume is a shorter summary of your skills and experience, typically 1â€“2 pages long.

    While CVs and resumes are used differently in countries like the U.S., they are often used interchangeably in places like India, Australia, and South Africa.

Researching a company helps you tailor your application and make a strong impression.

    Find Keywords: Use keywords from their website and job description to get your CV past automated systems.

    Check for a Photo: Know if a photo is expected in that country. In the U.S. and U.K., it's best to leave it off to avoid bias.

    Tailor Your Application: Understand the company's needs so you can show how your skills and experience are a perfect fit for the job.

To make your CV polished and easy to read, remember these key points:

    Tailor it for the job: Organize your CV to put your most relevant skills and experience front and center.

    Use clear headings: Use bold headings for each section to help a recruiter quickly find information.

    Use bullet points: Use bullet points to list your accomplishments and responsibilities. This makes the information easy to scan and digest.

    Keep it consistent: Use the same font, font size, and spacing throughout the entire document for a clean, professional look.
